# Goal

I recently completed the [Google Cybersecurity Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-cybersecurity), and I want to put some of what I’ve learned into practice. I know that analyzing captured packets is a fundamental skill, so I figured that a good first project would be to analyze some packets containing malware with WireShark that were captured in the real world. I’ll be getting the packet files from [Malware-Traffic-Analysis.net](http://Malware-Traffic-Analysis.net). 

Here is a list of pcaps I have analyzed to far (From most recent to oldest):
