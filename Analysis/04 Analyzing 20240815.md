# **Incident Report: Malware Infection Analysis at LaFontaineBleu**

**Context**  
This is my fourth ever pcap analysis. I am getting the pcaps from [https://malware-traffic-analysis.net](https://malware-traffic-analysis.net), specifically the exercise posted on [2024-08-15](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2024/08/15/index.html). I received advice about my revious report being too generic, so I’ll try to dive a bit deeper, and tailor the report to the specific situation / company.

**Scenario (from the assignment)**  
A Windows host was infected, and it seems to be from [WarmCookie](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.warmcookie) malware. The domain is LaFontaineBleu. The website no longer exists, so it may be a fake name just for the exercise. The scenario does not give any information about the kind of company it is, so no tailored advice can be given.

## **Incident Overview**

On August 15 at 00:12 in the morning, unusual behavior was detected from one computer on the network. It began probing the central server responsible for managing user accounts. It tried multiple times to log in using system credentials, and after some failures, it succeeded. After gaining access, it appeared to use those credentials to request higher-level access permissions.

The computer then communicated with sensitive systems and began requesting confidential directory information in a way that mimics how domain administrators operate. This suggests that the attacker managed to obtain high-level access — effectively giving them control over the network.

Several files were downloaded, after which fake cookies were sent to a C2 server. The fake cookies were likely used to hide data exfiltration.

## **Initial Infection Vector**

The initial likely infection happened the previous day. The system booted up and immediately showed signs of being compromised. Logs from the previous day need to be investigated.

## **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**

**Privilege escalation attempts**

On August 15, 2024, host `10.8.15.133` initiated a sequence of interactions with the domain controller at `10.8.15.4`. The activity began with LDAP enumeration and progressed into SMB protocol negotiation. The host made multiple Kerberos AS-REQ attempts, some failing due to pre-authentication requirements. Eventually, it received successful AS-REP responses, indicating successful authentication.

Following this, the host requested several TGS (service) tickets, and initiated DCE/RPC binds to the DRSUAPI interface — commonly used for domain controller replication. This likely indicates a DCSync attack, suggesting that the attacker gained domain-level privileges.

The use of SASL GSS-API binds and successful LDAP binds further supports the conclusion that privileged credentials were obtained. SMB session setups and Ioctl queries suggest the attacker began querying system and network information, potentially preparing for lateral movement or data exfiltration.

**Download and Data exfiltration**

The host started communicating with the suspected C2 server IP 72.5.43.29 which has a score of 12/94 on VirusTotal. An executable file was downloaded with the following hash:

Ab054c91138c6b66c526fd0d83da40c46ad1ee3935aea28460e167c1a002b0fa

Both the file and the hash had a score of 0 on VirusTotal

The same IP then started sending fake cookies every 4 seconds. The fake cookies were likely used to exfiltrate data.

**More downloads and beacons**

Investigating conversations that lasted for a long time and conversations that sent a lot of data relieved two more downloads from IPs and domains that have bad VirusTotal scores, as well as two beacons.

## **Analysis**

### **Affected System:**

Host IP: 10.8.15.133  
Host name: DESKTOP-H8ALZBV  
Username: desktop-h8alzbv$  
Full name: Pierce Lucero  
Domain: lafontainebleu\[.\]org  
Active Directory (AD) domain controller: 10.8.15\[.\]4 \- WIN-JEGJIX7Q9RS  
AD environment name: LAFONTAINBLEU

**C2 Servers**:

72.5.43.29 \- 12/94 on VirusTotal  
23.215.55.139 \- Beaconing  
104.21.55.70 \- Potential virus download and beaconing  
172.67.170.159 \- Potential virus download

Malicious domain:  
[business.checkfedexexp.com](http://business.checkfedexexp.com) \- 12 / 94 score on VirusTotal.  
[quote.checkfedexexp.com](http://quote.checkfedexexp.com) \- 14 / 94 score on VirusTotal.  
These domains are related to 172.67.170.159 and 104.21.55.70

### **Packet & alert information**

Packet capture starts at 00:09:43 UTC on August 15th 2024, and ends at 00:42:26 on the same day. 18189 packets were captured over 32 minutes and 43 seconds. The alerts start at 00:09 and end at 00:13. When looking at an I/O graph of the entire capture, we can see that most of the activity happens at the start, when we received the alerts.  
![][image1]

### **Methodology**

We received 12 alerts. The 5 out of the first 6 (1 was a false alarm) seem to be the malware trying to scout and escalate privileges. The later 6 are communications with the C2 server, where it downloaded a payload and then started exfiltrating data using fake cookies.  
![][image2]  
00:09:43 \- When looking at the start of the data capture, the system seems to be booting up. The host machine is making DHCP and ARP requests, as well DNS queries to internal domains. As the alerts start 1 second after bootup, the infection likely happened before this packet capture. The malware is likely programmed to activate as soon as the system booted up.  
00:09:44 \- The first alert is a DNS Standard query response, Name Error. It is initiated by the host 10.8.15.133 at the Ad Domain controller using port 53383\. A search for dns and udp.port \== 53383 in wireshark reveals a number of DNS requests that fail. These requests target internal subdomains within `lafontainebleu.local`, indicating potential reconnaissance or probing behavior to discover internal naming conventions.  
00:09:45 \- The second and third alerts are about a Microsoft Connection test that the host machine makes. A search for the IP address reveals it is an HTTP request totalling 9 packets. The HTTP request does not contain any malware. While Microsoft Connection tests are harmless on their own, it is sometimes used by malware to test the Internet connection. Considering the upcoming activity, it is very possible that this connection test is likely part of the initial infection staging process.  
00:09:45 \- The fourth alert is about the outdated TLSv1.0 being used. The IP for this conversation 23.33.138.184 does not show any hits on VirusTotal. When looking at the packets in Wireshark, TLSv1.3 is being used for these packets. While the timing is suspicious, this possibly is a false alarm.  
00:09:46 \- The fifth alert is regarding attempted kerberos principal name overflows from the host on the AD domain controller. When searching for `kerberos`, it shows attempts being made starting at 00:09:46. Doing a more comprehensive search for `kerberos || ldap || smb || smb2 || icmp` reveals even attack vectors, such as LDAP reconnaissance, SMB negotiation, TGS-REQ/REP exchanges, DCERPC and DRSUAPI Traffic. At 00:10:08, it succeeded its LDAP SASL bind request and SMB Session setup.  
00:10:19 \- The sixth alert is about a port being unreachable. The AD controller sent a DNS response to the infected host using port 59615, which is blocked. This could be a misconfiguration, but unlikely in this context. The request was for the bing website. What likely happened is that the malware used a legitimate website to look for what ports are open.  
00:11:58 \- All 6 remaining alerts about the IP 72.5.43.29, which is the suspected C2 server with a 12/94 score on VirusTotal. Every packet uses port 80 / HTTP. Despite the HTTP/port 80 usage, the alerts say that the data is an executable. I exported the executable, and both the hash and the file have a 0 score on VirusTotal. After the initial download, there is a continuous stream of smaller HTTP requests. These have a pattern, with about 4 seconds between every request. The content of the HTTP requests say they contain cookie data, but the cookie files likely contain data that it is trying to exfiltrate. The requests are too frequent and regular to be normal cookies, and the user agent data in the HTTP requests are fake (Internet Explorer 6 on Windows XP SP2). Something else that is strange is that every HTTP request after the initial payload at 00:11:59 is met with a 400 Bad request error. This likely means that the C2 server and the downloaded malware are not compatible. Perhaps the threat actor changed something on their C2 server since they developed the downloaded malware? Though another possibility is that it is just another trick and that the packets arrive just fine.

**Long duration**  
As malware rarely uses just one C2 server, I have used the Statistics \>\> Conversations tool to look at conversations with long durations. Malware often continuously sends data or beacons, so longer conversations are a good indicator.

204.79.197.203 \- Conversation starts at 00:10:13 and lasts for the entirety of the packet capture. 630 packets are sent in total, all using port 443 / TLS. There is a single HTTP stream, which mentions Microsoft Azure. There is no beaconing. The timing is suspicious, but this could be a normal process scheduled to happen some time after boot up. A search on VirusTotal confirms that this IP is owned by Microsoft.  
23.215.55.139 \- Conversation starts at 00:11:21 and lasts for the entirety of the packet capture. 105 packets are sent in total, all using port 443 / TLS, so it is encrypted. There is a very clear beaconing pattern as per this I/O graph:  
![][image3]  
When looking at the timestamps, there seems to be a 45 second interval between each spike on this graph. The IP 23.215.55.139 and a domain [bzib.nelreports.net](http://bzib.nelreports.net) that is mentioned in one of the HTTPS headers both have a 0 score on VirusTotal. As the same 45 second beaconing pattern is used for the next IP, it is very likely that this is also a C2 server  
104.21.55.70 \- Conversation starts at 00:10:58 and lasts for the entirety of the packet capture. 2275 packets are sent in total, all using port 80 / HTTP. There’s a huge amount of packets at the start, after which it starts beaconing every 45 seconds. On a graph, the initial spike is so large that the beaconing doesn’t even show on it. 3 MB of data downloaded from 104.21.55.70. Virustotal gives the IP a score of 0, and says that the IP belongs to CloudFlare. Maybe the threat actor is using a legitimate service as a proxy? Despite being HTTP, the content is either encrypted or is not text data. When downloading it and uploading the file and hash to VirusTotal, it says that it is a virus, but at the same time has not been detected by any services, so the score is 0\.  
52.113.194.132 \- Conversation starts at 00:11:22 and lasts for the entirety of the packet capture. 221 packets are sent in total, all using port 443 / TLS, so it is encrypted. There is a domain mentioned in some of the packets called [ecs.office.com](http://ecs.office.com). VirusTotal gives it a clean rating. There is no beaconing pattern or anything else I could find that is suspicious about this IP or the traffic coming from this IP.  
20.10.31.115 \- Conversation starts at 00:10:10 and lasts for the entirety of the packet capture. 107 packets are sent in total, all using port 443 / TLS, so it is encrypted. There is a domain mentioned in one of the packets called [client.wns.windows.com](http://client.wns.windows.com) which has a clean rating on VirusTotal. There is no beaconing pattern or anything else I could find that is suspicious about this IP or the traffic coming from this IP.

Large data volume  
104.21.55.70 \- As previously mentioned, 3 MB was downloaded from this IP, after which it started beaconing.  
172.67.170.159 \- At 00:11:24, about 1 MB of data is downloaded from this IP using HTTPS. No further traffic.There is a domain mentioned called [business.checkfedexexp.com](http://business.checkfedexexp.com) which has a 12/94 rating on VirusTotal. When doing a search for DNS queries that mention fedex, there is another domain called [quote.checkfedexexp.com](http://quote.checkfedexexp.com) which has a score of 14 / 94 on VirusTotal. When looking at the details, both domains mention two IPs: 172.67.170.159 and 104.21.55.70, which are the two IPs that the two big downloads came from.

**Key Findings** 

* Infection happened before the packet capture started.  
* Malware was activated when the host 10.8.15.133 booted up and started to scout immediately  
* Malware used several vectors to attempt to escalate its privileges, and eventually succeeds  
* An executable is downloaded using HTTP from an IP 72.5.43.29, which is the suspected C2 server  
* Smaller HTTP packets are sent to the C2 server every 4 seconds or so. The packets contain fake cookies. Suspected data exfiltration.  
* Looking for suspicious conversations revealed two more downloads from 172.67.170.159 and 104.21.55.70, and two more beacons on 23.215.55.139 and 104.21.55.70.

## **Recommendations**

1. **Containment**:  
* Isolate DESKTOP-H8ALZBV from the network. Either unplug the network cable if on-site, or block the machine if remote. The malware currently has full control over the network, so this is urgent\!  
* Reset credentials for the host and AD controller accounts  
* Scan the 10.8.15.0 subnet for activity from the malicious IPs and domains.  
2. **Eradication**:  
* Get an image of the machine so it can be put in a VM for testing.  
* View host logs to see when initial infection may have happened.  
* Restore the host to an earlier configuration, preferably some time ago, as the timing of the initial infection is unclear.  
3. **Detection**:  
* If the unencrypted virus executable can be obtained from the host machine, get the hash and signature so a Suricata rule can be created.  
* The malware used several methods to escalate privileges, and only a few of them were detected. Deploy Suricata rules for LDAP reconnaissance, SMB negotiation, TGS-REQ/REP exchanges, DCERPC and DRSUAPI Traffic, LDAP SASL bind request and SMB Session setup.  
4. **Prevention**:  
* Block the IPs 72.5.43.29, 23.215.55.139, 104.21.55.70, 172.67.170.159 at the firewall and web proxy. Do the same for the domains [business.checkfedexexp.com](http://business.checkfedexexp.com) and [quote.checkfedexexp.com](http://quote.checkfedexexp.com)  
* Patch all systems in the LAFONTAINBLEU domain for SMB and Kerberos vulnerabilities, prioritizing domain controllers.  
* Enable strict SMB signing and Kerberos pre-authentication in the AD environment to block similar exploits.  
5. **Further Analysis**:  
* Investigate an image of the infected host in Virtualbox. Get the downloaded files and analyze their full capabilities.  
* With full capabilities investigated, try to find out what information was sent to the C2 server in those fake cookies.

## **Conclusion**

After boot up, host DESKTOP-H8ALZBV probing the central server responsible for managing user accounts. After gaining access, it appeared to use those credentials to request higher-level access permissions. With elevated privileges, the host downloaded several files and started sending fake cookies to a C2 server. The fake cookies were likely used to hide data exfiltration.

**AI feedback**  
I asked Grok again to give feedback, and he gave me the following pointers:  
**Chase the Malware Name**: When the scenario names a malware (WarmCookie), cross-reference its TTPs (e.g., fake cookies, CloudFlare IPs) with your findings. Use threat intel (OTX, Recorded Future) to confirm.  
**Dig into Initial Traffic**: Analyze early packets (DHCP, DNS, HTTP) for infection clues, even if pre-capture. Check for suspicious domains or email protocols.  
**Deepen C2 Analysis**: Inspect HTTP POST payloads, TLS certificates, and beacon data volumes. Quantify spikes (e.g., “3 MB initial download, 200-byte beacons”).  
**Prove Exploits**: For DCSync or Kerberos overflows, cite specific packets (e.g., frame numbers, DRSUAPI binds) or errors to back your claims.  
**Rich IoCs**: Include URLs, file metadata, and certificate details. Export all possible files, even if encrypted, for analysis.
